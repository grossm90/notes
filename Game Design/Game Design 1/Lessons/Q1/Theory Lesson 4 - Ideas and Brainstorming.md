## Finding Game Ideas

While programming is difficult, finding good game ideas is the _hardest_ part of game development. What are some good ways to get game ideas?

-   **More Context**: Watch cool shows and movies, read books comics and manga, listen to great music artists. The more media you consume, the more context you have for great ideas.
-   **Branch Out**: Do you love comic book movies and Star Wars? So does every nerdy game programmer! Awesome new ideas are only going to come from new contexts.
-   **Touch Grass**: Have you ever wondered why great ideas always seem to arrive in the shower? This is probably because that is the last place in our lives that doesn't have a screen in it. Our brains need room to think without distraction. Go for a walk with no music and let the ideas flow.
-   **Find a Gamedev Community**: The internet isn't all distracting 5-second video content. There are still communities that come together to discuss ideas. Find a forum that has game developers who are willing to share their thoughts.
-   **Play Really Bad Games**: Believe it or not, bad video games can be incredibly informative on how to make great games. A lot of times, a bad game was only bad because of its bad execution. You may be the person that mines the great idea out of a flop.
-   **Play Non-Video Games**: Play card-games, board-games, or sports. So many great games are spin-offs of non-video games, such as _Rocket League_, and _Balatro_.
-   **Look to Your Passions**: Satoshi Tajiri created _Pokemon_ from his love of collecting insects. You never know how many people share the same hobbies and passions as you, or how many people don't know anything about your passions, but will have an awesome time with them. Find a way to turn your passions into a game idea.

### ~~Steal~~ Iterate and Innovate

New ideas are never truly original. Many people think of _Pong_ as the first video game, but even that was inspired by _Tennis for Two_ which of course, was inspired by the real life game of tennis. It's okay to use other game ideas as long as you twist them, tweak them, or combine them with other ideas.

## Brainstorming

Once you have some game ideas, it's good to get them on paper. The brainstorming process is pretty simple. Get yourself some blank paper, something to write with, a quiet room, and (optionally) some teammates to collaborate with. It is important to keep in mind some ground rules:

-   **Blue-Sky**: No ideas are bad ideas
-   **Diversify**: Make sure to include artists, programmers, game-tests, etc. to your collab team if you can

### Design the Game-Case

A game's case is basically like a movie poster. It is a super efficient way at telling people what the game is about. We can use this idea to help us brainstorm. Design a mock-up of a game-case for your game idea. This will help you narrow down the most important and fun aspects.

### Defeat Writer's Block

Working off of inspiration alone will only get us so far. Discipline is what gets us across the finish line. If you get stuck in the brainstorming phase, here are some techniques to break through.

-   **Narrow your focus**: Maybe you are biting off too much. If you are thinking of a theme for a platforming game, maybe think of some themes for a single level. After a few level themes, you may then be able to tie them together with an overall theme.
-   **Touch Grass**: Get outside, feel the fresh air, and move your body. All of these are proven ways to get your thoughts moving.
-   **Jump Ahead**: Don't think of the writing process as a linear movement from the beginning of the game to the end. You can jump around to the ideas that excite you the most, then circle back to stuff you find to be more of a grind when you have the energy.

## You Don't Know What Fun Is

Unfortunately, it seems to be a universal truth that we don't know what is fun while we're planning. It isn't until we're actually experiencing something that we know if it's fun or not. Our brain is really good at convincing us our ideas are flawless. Don't trust your imagination alone. Create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), as discussed in our previous lesson, and test the game mechanics yourself. Have your friends test the game mechanics, your parents, your dog, have as many different people test it as you can.
