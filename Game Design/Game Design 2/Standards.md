# 8208120 Game & Simulation Design

## Course Description:

This course covers fundamental principles of designing a game or a simulation application, rules and strategies of play, conditional branching, design and development constraints, use of sound and animation, design tools, and implementation issues.  The content includes market research, product design documentation, storyboarding, proposal development, and presentation of a project report.  Emphasis is placed on the techniques needed to develop well-documented, structured game or simulation programs.  Extensive use is made of evaluating and analyzing existing games or simulations.
