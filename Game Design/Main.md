# CIP Number:

0550041116

# Purpose:

This program offers a sequence of courses that provides coherent and rigorous content aligned with challenging academic standards and relevant technical knowledge and skills needed to prepare for further education and careers such as a Game/Simulation Designer, Game Programmer, and Game Software Developer in the Information Technology career cluster; provides technical skill proficiency, and includes competency-based applied learning that contributes to the academic knowledge, higher-order reasoning and problem-solving skills, work attitudes, general employability skills, technical skills, and occupation-specific skills, and knowledge of all aspects of the Information Technology career cluster.

The content includes but is not limited to practical experiences in game/simulation conceptualization, design, storyboarding, development methodologies, essential programming techniques, and implementation issues.  Specialized programming skills involving advanced mathematical calculations and physics are also integrated into the curriculum.

# Program Recommendations:

This program is project-based and focuses on broad, transferable skills and stresses understanding and demonstration of the following rudiments of the game and simulation industry: production planning, elements of production design, storyboarding, elements of visual design, integration of digital audio and digital video into new game/simulation productions, programming for single and multi-user environments, delivery systems, and collaboration/teamwork.

The Foundations and Design courses should be taken in sequence prior to the Programming and Multi-User Programming courses.  The Programming and Multi-User Programming courses may be taken concurrently. It is highly recommended that students complete a programming course prior to taking the last two courses of this program.  Digital Information Technology may be taken concurrently with either the Foundations course or the Design course.

The Programming (8208330) and Multiuser Programming (8208340) courses should be offered with a concentration on one programming language to ensure students are prepared for industry certifications.

The Game/Simulation/Animation Programming program lends itself to integration of the core academic subjects of language arts, math, science, visual arts, and social studies into project activities.  It is through a balanced and integrated curriculum that students attain the attitudes, skills, and knowledge needed to compete successfully in today's work force.  To achieve total curriculum integration, academic and career and technical education teachers should be scheduled with common planning times.

# Common Career Technical Core – Career Ready Practices:

Career Ready Practices describe the career-ready skills that educators should seek to develop in their students.  These practices are not exclusive to a Career Pathway, program of study, discipline or level of education.  Career Ready Practices should be taught and reinforced in all career exploration and preparation programs with increasingly higher levels of complexity and expectation as a student advances through a program of study.

1. Act as a responsible and contributing citizen and employee.
2. Apply appropriate academic and technical skills.
3. Attend to personal health and financial well-being.
4. Communicate clearly, effectively and with reason.
5. Consider the environmental, social and economic impacts of decisions.
6. Demonstrate creativity and innovation.
7. Employ valid and reliable research strategies.
8. Utilize critical thinking to make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.
9. Model integrity, ethical leadership and effective management.
10. Plan education and career path aligned to personal goals.
11. Use technology to enhance productivity.
12. Work productively in teams while using cultural/global competence.
