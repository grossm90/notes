## What is Video?
"Video" comes from the Latin word with the same spelling that translates to "I see". We can think of it as  the visual version of the Latin "audio" that translates to "I hear". Its earliest modern usage refers to the video broadcast signal sent to televisions when the technology was first becoming popular. Therefore, we can interpret the "video" in "video game" as being a "video signal" specifically, as opposed to say, film like a movie in a theater. It would be very difficult to create an interactive game using film on a reel.

## What is a Game?
This definition is a bit more difficult as it can be very subjective. Some people believe that any interactive activity for the purpose of entertainment can be a game. Others will argue that if there is no way to win or lose the activity, then it is not a game. For example, playing with Lego is an entertaining activity (they sell millions of kits a year), but you can't really win or lose when playing with Lego.

So, can playing with Lego be made into game? Certainly, all we have to do is add a win/lose condition. For example, you could try to complete the kit within a certain time limit, or before your friend with the same kit completes theirs.

This new requirement may disqualify some of your favorite "games" from being games. Was Minecraft (before the addition of "The End") not a game? There was no win/lose condition without the Ender Dragon. What about The Sims? What do you think? Do sandboxes where the player decides for themselves what the goals count as "games"?

## What is a Video Game
So now we have our definition. A video game is an entertaining activity with a win/lose condition that is interacted with through a video signal.
