At a high level, all computers are made up of a processor (CPU), memory, and input/output devices.
Each computer receives input from a variety of devices, processes that data with the CPU and memory, and sends results to some form of output.

## Input and Output Devices


### Input

The very first computers only accepted "punch cards" as input. Computer scientists had to carefully punch out their instructions and then feed the cards into the computer.

Fortunately, computers have come a long way since the 1970s, and we can now input data into them using a variety of easy-to-use devices. The most common input devices are the keyboard, mouse, and touch screen.

There are hundreds of other input devices, like microphones to capture sound waves, scanners to capture image data, and virtual reality devices to capture our body movements.
Computers also receive input from their environment using "sensors", like motion sensors that detect changes in movement.

### Output

Once the CPU is done processing the data, it often needs to output a result.
A standard output device is the computer monitor, which displays text, images, and user interface elements by lighting up thousands of pixels with different colors.

There are many other ways a computer could output data. As long as the output device can interpret a stream of 1s and 0s, it can turn that data into anything - headphones output sound, printers output ink on paper, and projectors output light.

## Central Processing Unit (CPU)

The CPU is the brain of a computer, containing all the circuitry needed to process input, store data, and output results.

The CPU is constantly following instructions of computer programs that tell it which data to process and how to process it. Without a CPU, we could not run programs on a computer.

For example, a simple calculator program might instruct the CPU to take two numbers, 2 and 2, add them, and send back the result.

The CPU can process those instructions easily, thanks to a control unit that knows how to interpret program instructions and an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) that knows how to add numbers. With the control unit and ALU combined, the CPU can process much more complex programs than a simple calculator.

### Inside the CPU

At the hardware level, a CPU is an integrated circuit, also known as a chip. An integrated circuit "integrates" millions or billions of tiny electrical parts, arranging them into circuits and fitting them all into a compact box.

## Random Access Memory (RAM)

When input devices send binary data to a CPU, it immediately stores that data in memory to make it easier to process.
Let's say we ask a computer to add 2 + 4. Here's what it will do:

- Store 2 (`0010`) and 4 (`0100`) in memory
- Use a circuit in the CPU to calculate the result
- Store 6 (`0110`) in memory

Since the CPU is constantly using data from memory, they're connected via a memory bus, a high speed communication transfer system, typically made from wires, conductors, or optical fibers.

### Memory size

Memory is designed for fast access and typically stores only the data and instructions that are necessary for the currently running programs on a computer.

Computer memory isn't infinite, so there's a limit to how much data we can input before we overflow the memory. Computers also vary a lot in memory size, usually because of physical size constraints. A desktop computer can remember more than your phone, but your phone can remember more than the Raspberry Pi.

### Memory types

This type of memory, also called main memory or RAM (Random Access Memory), is only used for temporary storage of data. When you restart a computer, it typically wipes the memory entirely. Memory wouldn't be a good place to store data for later, like files and programs.

Computers store long-term data in a different type of memory: external memory or secondary storage, like a hard drive or USB drive.

## Secondary Memory

When computers need to store data for long-term retrieval, they use secondary memory, also known as auxiliary storage or external memory.

### Storage types

Personal computers come with a hard drive, a permanently attached secondary storage. Many computers have input ports for USB drives or SD cards, forms of portable secondary storage. That allows us to store lots on our computers, but also to easily transfer from one computer to another.

### Storage speed

To the computer, all secondary storage acts the same way. The CPU can write data into storage and it can read data from storage.

To the user, what matters is the speed of those read/write operations. Flash memory is faster than its predecessors, so most new computers come with that.
